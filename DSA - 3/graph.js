// What is a Graph?
// A Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of:

// Nodes (Vertices) → Represent entities (e.g., people, cities, computers).
// Edges → Represent relationships between nodes (e.g., roads, friendships, network connections).

// Types of Graphs
// 1️⃣ Based on Direction of Edges
// Undirected Graph → Edges have no direction (e.g., friendship in social media).
// Directed Graph (Digraph) → Edges have a specific direction (e.g., one-way road).
// 2️⃣ Based on Weight of Edges
// Unweighted Graph → All edges are equal (e.g., social networks).
// Weighted Graph → Each edge has a weight (e.g., road distances).
// 3️⃣ Based on Connectivity
// Connected Graph → Every node is reachable from any other node.
// Disconnected Graph → Some nodes are isolated.
// 4️⃣ Special Graphs
// Tree → A connected acyclic graph.
// DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) → No cycles; used in scheduling, dependencies.
// Bipartite Graph → Vertices can be split into two groups with no internal connections.
